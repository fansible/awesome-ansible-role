# Awesome Ansible roles

We provide here a list of Ansible roles we use in our projects. A lot of them are only designed to work with **Ubuntu** in order to keep them really *simple*.

Pro tips:

When you use a role found on github or [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/),
you shouldn't use a requirements.txt to include the roles in your projects, commit them!
Check [our article](https://www.theodo.fr/blog/2015/10/best-practices-to-build-great-ansible-playbooks/) for more explanations.

For roles more specific to a Symfony or a Node.Js project, see our [generator of playbooks](https://github.com/fansible/tywin).
