# awesome-ansible-role

We provide here a list of Ansible roles we use in our projects.

Pro tips:

When you use a role found on github or [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/),
you shouldn't use a requirements.txt to include the roles in your projects, commit them!
Check [our article](https://www.theodo.fr/blog/2015/10/best-practices-to-build-great-ansible-playbooks/) for more explanations.
